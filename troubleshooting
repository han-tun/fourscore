FourScore Troubleshooting
=================

These are tips from developing this version of Foursquare: http://www.afr.com/p/national/interactive_what_do_you_think_of_xEhRGGELZo9qzk8yKZ8dbL

Grid size:
When you're putting dummy data to test the grid out make sure you don't enter values outside the size of your grid as the fourscore won't render. For example, you can't have a value of 8 if your grid size is 10 as 10x10 is the maximum size. A grid size of 10 would have a maximum corner value of -/+5, -/+5.

Colors:
If too many responses cluster into a few squares you'll need a scale that has more gradients otherwise only the really popular squares will show up in the grid.

Google forms:
If you want the latest comments to show up at the top of the comment box, activate filter on the spreadsheet and reverse the order based on time.
